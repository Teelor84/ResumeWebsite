        <h2 class="mstHeader">Meeting Scheduler Tool for NUWC</h2>
        <p class="nuwcText">
          During my senior year at UMass Dartmouth, I was required to complete a
          capstone project alongside 3 others. Our project was to create a
          meeting scheduler tool for the Naval Undersea Warfare Center in
          Newport, Rhode Island. Their current system at the time displayed all
          meetings at once and had issues in regards to overlapping meetings.
          Thus our task was to make a better system for them. The result of this
          was the creation of a proto-website that NUWC would later upload into
          their own internal network for security reasons. It utilized
          Javascript, HTML/CSS and MySQL in order to handle the database that
          would hold the meeting rooms and factors such as room features or
          availability. My role in this project was part of the backend team
          handling the MySQL tables but I also helped handle less technical
          aspects like sprint reports and client meetings, all under the Agile
          framework.

        <p class="androidText">
          This project is a music quiz app developed using Android Studio and
          the features associated with it. This app asks users 10 questions
          which will lead to a result at the end for their potential favorite
          music genre. It utilizes a MySQLite database to keep track of the
          genres that get a point based off of the users answer, using queries
          in order to add points to a specific area of the table, compare the
          numerical values in the table, return a value from the table based on
          that comparison and truncate the table on app startup. The app also
          utilizes other Android features such as calls to the Google Maps API
          in order to open up Google Maps to a specific location based off the
          result of the quiz. It can also pause and play videos that are locally
          stored. It utilizes XML for the front-end and for onClick button
          integration.
